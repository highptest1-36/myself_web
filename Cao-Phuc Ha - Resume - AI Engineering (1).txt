WORK EXPERIENCE
  * July 2025 – Present
    Drone Assembly and Control Engineer at , 
      Assembled and balanced a custom-built drone using the Pixhawk 4 flight controller for precise tuning and flight optimization. Integrated Jetson Orin Nano for onboard AI processing tasks such as human tracking, package delivery, and GPS-based navigation with an M9N GPS module. Designed the system for fully autonomous and real-time operation, ensuring stable flight performance and efficient AI inference during mission execution.

  * January 2023 – Present
    Self-Driving Car Development at , 
      Developed and deployed advanced control algorithms for autonomous vehicles integrating both simulation and real-world systems. Designed lane-following, obstacle avoidance, and stabilization modules using Hough Transform and AI-based object detection models (YOLO) to recognize lanes, traffic signs, and obstacles. Combined PID and Sliding Mode Control (SMC) techniques for precise steering and stability. Collected and labeled driving data in Unity simulation for model training and implemented real-time inference on Jetson Nano and Orange Pi for on-edge AI processing. Utilized Arduino and STM32 microcontrollers to manage vehicle motor control and sensor integration.

  * March 2025 – April 2025
    Virtual Assistant for FPT at , Ho Chi Minh 
      Combined speech recognition, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and NLP to provide intelligent responses from FPTU document sources. Extended the assistant’s capabilities to multi-modal interaction, enabling real-time camera input processing for gesture and object recognition. Users can control and request services through natural voice commands, with the system autonomously performing actions such as scanning, retrieving information, or initiating tasks based on visual context. Deployed lightweight models on edge devices for seamless interaction, low-latency response, and offline usability in smart environments

  * January 2024 – Present
    Real-Time Video Processing with NLP and CV at , 
      Deploy real-time video processing using AI models such as NanoLLM, NanoOWL, and OWL-ViT for object and text recognition. The models are optimized with TensorRT for efficient processing on embedded devices like the Jetson Orin Nano. Integrate a chatbot feature, allowing users to interact and ask questions with the live video.

  * January 2025 – September 2025
    XAI for Bitcoin Price Prediction at , 
      Integrated Explainable AI (XAI) techniques into Bitcoin price forecasting using XGBoost, LSTM, and SVM models. Compared prediction accuracy across models and applied interpretability methods such as SHAP and LIME to provide insights into model decision-making and feature importance for market behavior analysis.
